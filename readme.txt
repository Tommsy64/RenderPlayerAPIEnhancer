Version 1.0 for Minecraft 1.12.1

Description
===========

Render Player API Enhancer is a Minecraft Forge core mod which tries to modify third party armor models to use Render Player API.

While the modifications done to those armor models at runtime can be beneficial, this can also lead to a completely malfunctioning system.

!! USE WITH CAUTION !!


Implementation
--------------

Render Player API Enhancer will violently force ALL classes that:

* extend 'net.minecraft.client.model.ModelBiped' and
* have a canonical name that matches at least one of the candidate class names or patterns

to use Render Player API by

* changing their super class from 'net.minecraft.client.model.ModelBiped' to 'api.player.model.ModelPlayerArmor' and
* removing all locally declared methods that overwrite methods used by Render Player API in case they dont't call their super method at least on one execution path.


Motivation
----------

This can fix various incompatibilities between:

* player animation changing mods and
* player armor model adding mods.

This can also screw everything up, so use with caution.


Configuration
-------------

Render Player API Enhancer can be configured using the files "render_player_api_Enhancer_classnames.txt" and "render_player_api_Enhancer_classnamepatterns.txt" which are automatically generated in the minecraft folder during startup when not already present.

They are both simple text files for canonical java class names respecively 'java.util.regex.Pattern' strings.

All classes which transformed canonical class names match at least one of these class names or patterns are considered candidates for being modified by Render Player API Enhancer.
